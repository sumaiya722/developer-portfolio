            <h3>Self tought web and Java developer</h3>
            <p>
                An enthusiastic fresher with highly motivated and leadership skills having bachelors of engineering
                degree in Computer Science and Engineering. Eager to learn new technologies and methodologies. Always
                willing to innovate the new things which can improve the existing technology. Love to take challenges
                and motivate myself towards improvising for the betterment.Besides,I have been learning web development
                and android/Java programming during my leisure time. I think this is a good investment of my time as it
                prepares me for the upcoming world. I beleive that in future each and every one must learn atleast one
                coding language. Also, i find it very satisfying to learn something new instead of wasting time on
                social media.
